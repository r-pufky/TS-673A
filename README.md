# TS-877

This is a simple hack to change Guillaume Valadon's TS-453Be ITE IT8528 Super I/O controller "panq" utility to provide status and controls on my QNAP TS-877.  Guillaume's modules were basically written to support multiple fans already, so little work was needed here.

Thank you to Guillaume!
